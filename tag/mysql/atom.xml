&lt;p&gt;Xenon is a web desktop, which means that all your applications, work and settings are stored on the web. It can be run from any Internet-connected computer by browsing to the Xenon server or from your own server (in the case that you want a private instance, or want it installed into a netbook in the case where you do not have Internet connectivity). Eventually syncing support will be brought in which allows you to sync your settings and files to and from your local instance and the main server. Other features currently available include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio player (featuring HTML5 Vorbis audio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video player (featuring HTML5 Theora video)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picture viewer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email (including within Xenon and outgoing email)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chatroom (Public, open to all on the same instance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friends application for social features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Files, to upload various types of file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wallpaper switcher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcoming features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settings syncing and importing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small footprint netbook/touchbook operating system to run on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try the system out for yourself, you can &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107134808/https://xenon.kevinghadyani.com/"&gt;try the demo&lt;/a&gt; (edit 2021: archived) or download the software at xenon.kevinghadyani.com/xenon_alpha2.tar.bz2 (edit 2021: not archived) to your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send patches, icons, ideas, apps, et al to &lt;a href="mailto:xenon@dandart.co.uk"&gt;xenon@dandart.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xenon is a browser-based GUI designed to be implemented on netbooks. The difference between other netbook OSes and cloud systems is that not only can you test it online, it will also be installed on netbooks - which will update from the Web automatically, giving you updates, and ability to use it without being connected to the Internet due to a local web server instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will have a very small footprint - being built on very few programs, and so will run on very low-end systems, so it will bring life to your old computers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now looking for helpers to make this project a reality. If you are a designer or a programmer who can program using any combination of (X)HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP or MySQL, then we would like you to help us out. We are afraid pay is out of the question at the moment, until we start selling subscriptions to the web service, the budget is zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas to help the project along, then please give us feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply, simply email: &lt;a href="mailto:dan.dart@googlemail.com"&gt;dan.dart@googlemail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
