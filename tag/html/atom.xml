A description of the project follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenon is a portable web or browser based desktop for netbooks and thin clients, designed to be the easiest desktop ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desktop includes a new GUI stepping away from traditional menus and is optimised for touchscreen and small devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system integrates social networking features and standard desktop features into one software package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being browser-based, it is cross platform and cross architecture. It is built on HTML5 and PHP components, and can be run on extremely low-powered machines, allowing for cheap distribution and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backend can be run online (for users to access their data everywhere), on a personal LAN server, or on a small device, so the system can work offline, or if there are concerns about cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An API is available at xenon.kevinghadyani.com/wiki/index.php/Developing_Apps (edit 2021: page not archived), so anyone can start developing apps to distribute in Xenon's upcoming App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project's homepage is located at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091220083328/http://hackerlanes.com/"&gt;http://hackerlanes.com&lt;/a&gt; (edit 2021: archived) including the online desktop, ready for instant testing and a download of the alpha image for your server. The actual small footprint OS that will run on netbooks will come later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage contributions to the project, in the form of code (the languages currently used are (X)HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL), art (eg icons, backgrounds, GUI concepts) or even just ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send any requests or contributions, or to join the project, please email the head developer at &lt;a href="mailto:dan.dart@googlemail.com"&gt;dan.dart@googlemail.com&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2009/12/xenon-alpha-released"/></entry><entry><id>xenon-project-looking-for-helpers</id><title type="text">Xenon Project looking for helpers!</title><updated>2009-10-14 14:17:00 UTC</updated><author><name>Dan Dart</name></author><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started a project some time ago, which is for now called "Codename: Project Xenon".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenon is a browser-based GUI designed to be implemented on netbooks. The difference between other netbook OSes and cloud systems is that not only can you test it online, it will also be installed on netbooks - which will update from the Web automatically, giving you updates, and ability to use it without being connected to the Internet due to a local web server instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will have a very small footprint - being built on very few programs, and so will run on very low-end systems, so it will bring life to your old computers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now looking for helpers to make this project a reality. If you are a designer or a programmer who can program using any combination of (X)HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP or MySQL, then we would like you to help us out. We are afraid pay is out of the question at the moment, until we start selling subscriptions to the web service, the budget is zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas to help the project along, then please give us feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply, simply email: &lt;a href="mailto:dan.dart@googlemail.com"&gt;dan.dart@googlemail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
