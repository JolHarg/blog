Believe it or not I wouldn't mind if people advertised their wares to me if they did it in a reasonable way and it was interesting, but most people are doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've come up with some sensible rules to stay within my personal limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DOs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DO provide relevant content for your users related to the subject material of the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DO market research about your customers: the more you know about them, the more you know what they like and the more clicks you'll get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DO invest in prospect analytics platforms like CANDDi to better understand your audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DO provide more text than images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DO try to keep any media included to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Do NOTs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT advertise irrelevant or spam material such as drugs, gambling or uninteresting products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT obscure other more relevant content such as the body of an article by using any form of pop-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT automatically play audio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT play potentially distracting videos without user input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT use flash as this pretty much destroys SEO and ruins experiences, memory and bandwidth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT take up a lot of screen real-estate, as this can affect content on phones or poorly designed menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT prioritise your material over the actual content of the page or provide any sort of delay to get to the content wished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT take over or modify existing content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to include video at all as this can hurt people's bandwidth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to necessitate a "close" button - they should be non-intrusive enough not to get in the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe people will hate them less if they obey these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some examples of people who do it wrong:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube is one of the worst offenders because it disobeys every single rule here. But a site such as what AdBard used to do sensibly obeys all the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, I'll even include space on the next iteration of my own website for relevant advertising if they sensibly obey these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note - this blog is to be moved to my own site soon - so stay posted for a link.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2012/05/rules-of-website-advertising"/></entry><entry><id>how-to-conquer-desktop</id><title type="text">How to Conquer the Desktop</title><updated>2009-08-19 19:28:00.001 UTC</updated><author><name>Dan Dart</name></author><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does Sturmbahnfahrer mean? And who would have guessed the meaning of Stormbaan Coureur? They are different names for the same software: "a simulated obstacle course for automobiles".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now grab someone off the street and ask them what Linux means. No? A "command-line" operating system is all you'll get from a lot of people. Most people who have used Linux before the year 2000 have had some sort of problem, due to usability, and it has put them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, ask them what Windows means. Sure, it's an English word and English is fast becoming the language of choice. It has two meanings: "A piece of glass" or "What my computer always says first". People don't know anything about operating systems. What your computer has is what it will have forever, is most people's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change systems then is a frightening step to many and many won't be clever enough to understand the concept that something will "exist outside of Windows".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wubi meanwhile (a program to install Ubuntu "inside" Windows) will just confuse people even more. If they understand Ubuntu is another program, they won't get why they can't just use their own programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don't care about how free or open their system is. They'll buy Windows 7 because they'll probably hate Vista or be forced into it. We had a little legroom while Vista was out since Windows users started looking around for something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, people fear change. They won't move away from what they're used to even if it is fundamentally broken or flawed or just keeps crashing. The only way to wrench people away is to add more small Linux-based devices to the market. Netbooks are doing pretty well in this area. Due to people not recognising it as a computer (or a laptop) people will be more open to what is on it. The same happened with the iPhone. The software is different, yes, but the hardware is also different, so people feel that they can accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change people with an open mind (a lot of users are switching already) we need to follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STANDARDISE!! This is the most confusing aspect. Have ONE standard distro, call it something cool and DON'T mention Linux. Have ONE standard Desktop Environment. Everyone knows how to use it, it's all the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have ONE Package manager. That means ONE way of installing. It won't break if more people work on it. Have packages downloadable in a format inclusive of all the libraries. Also have an add and remove panel. Repositories are cool. They have made our software secure. Let's have ONE repository containing only GUI end user applications, named after their use (Image Editor not GIMP) and have essential packages built into the system. No library packages, no dependencies, Just download Image Editor and it works. Perhaps like Acorn or Mac OS, in which you drag and drop the program to your desktop and it works. If duplicate libraries from packages exist, keep the newer. If packages break, the library has dropped support for something, so don't drop it! If a console app exists now, make a standard frontend for configuring it. E.g. Web server package (inAdvanced section) installs Apache AND a STANDARD frontend, All its libraries are there in the package. One package file to install for Web server. One to install for File Server. And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard packages. Have ONE text editor. If it lacks features from others, add them. Have a beginner and advanced mode. Etc. Call them "Text Editor" not "nano" or "kate" or "gedit". What the hell are those?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertising. Advertise like you've never advertise before! PRODUCT! And why you should buy it! It's cool! Let's all get on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STABLE! If things can break, fix them BEFORE releasing. Ubuntu releases broken products (look at 8.10). Debian delays but releases when finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HARDWARE! My brother's iPod Nano doesn't work in Linux straight away. This is one thing that will leave people ditching Linux. My 3D games I downloaded don't work. I don't want to have to bother with nVidia drivers. My camera doesn't get picked up. I can't sync to my MTP media player out of the box. Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Command Line. No one should EVER have to type anything into a console. It's simple user-friendliness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's all work on this and soon we'll have a user friendly system, easy to use, ready for the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing project to conquer this challenge. Its codename is Xenon and it tries to do all this in the browser. It can be used on all devices and will be installed on small devices.
