&lt;p&gt;This website has now been successfully built with GHC 9.4!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer bug reports and overrides to support it, but you can always check the website sources: &lt;a href="https://github.com/danwdart/websites.git" class="uri"&gt;https://github.com/danwdart/websites.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very good job to you, Haskell and GHC maintainers!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2022/10/this-blog-now-built-with-ghc-94"/></entry><entry><id>welcome-to-my-new-tech-blog</id><title type="text">Welcome to my new tech blog</title><updated>2022-09-11 22:24:11 UTC</updated><author><name>Dan Dart</name></author><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new tech blog! It's intended for things attributable to JolHarg (e.g. release announcements, tutorials, news, assorted tech things), in order to separate my non-code/non-"official" thoughts and opinions from those of my company, for what it's worth. This isn't due to anything I plan to say, but rather so that people who would like code-only thoughts can get them. I've moved some of my older posts from &lt;a href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk"&gt;my old blog&lt;/a&gt; to here if they were better attributed, too. Please let me know if you think I've miscategorised anything. Please also remember to reset your RSS feed reader, if you use the atom feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time here, my &lt;a href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk"&gt;non-tech blog is here&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk/atom.xml"&gt;atom feed is here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the comments are back!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2022/09/welcome-to-my-new-tech-blog"/></entry><entry><id>this-blog-now-built-with-ghc-92</id><title type="text">This blog now built with GHC 9.2</title><updated>2022-03-24 19:13:00 UTC</updated><author><name>Dan Dart</name></author><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Huzzah! This blog and set of websites has finally been built using the new latest version of GHC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst it's not doing anything that special, it marks the ability to use this version to compile all its dependencies, which have had to be modified, bug-reported and pull-requested to get it all to work, and worked around when these have not been responded to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've forked a bunch of my dependencies to get them to work, and am very happy that I'm free to update the dependencies I use to work for my needs, and that's really the power of free/libre open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually quite surprised that the release cycle of GHC itself seems so quick, and it's the main libraries that many people use that lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xenon is a web desktop, which means that all your applications, work and settings are stored on the web. It can be run from any Internet-connected computer by browsing to the Xenon server or from your own server (in the case that you want a private instance, or want it installed into a netbook in the case where you do not have Internet connectivity). Eventually syncing support will be brought in which allows you to sync your settings and files to and from your local instance and the main server. Other features currently available include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Audio player (featuring HTML5 Vorbis audio) * Video player (featuring HTML5 Theora video) * Picture viewer * Email (including within Xenon and outgoing email) * Blog * Chatroom (Public, open to all on the same instance) * Notes application * Friends application for social features * My Files, to upload various types of file * Wallpaper switcher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcoming features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Settings syncing and importing * A small footprint netbook/touchbook operating system to run on * Many others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try the system out for yourself, you can &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107134808/http://xenon.kevinghadyani.com/"&gt;try the demo&lt;/a&gt; (edit 2021: archived) or download the software at xenon.kevinghadyani.com/xenon_alpha2.tar.bz2 (edit 2021: not archived) to your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send patches, icons, ideas, apps, et al to &lt;a href="mailto:xenon@dandart.co.uk"&gt;xenon@dandart.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For me, I use a fair few to the extent that I don't use OpenOffice any more, just Google Apps. What particularly provoked me is that big companies are now doing it the whole hog. (see www.linux.com/feed/151604 (edit 2021: sorry, page not archived)) So I've decided to make one. It should be: Easy to use Intuitive Aesthetically pleasing Not be anything like today's GUIs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gathered a few people to help me with this big task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another blog, "5 things I wish Linux had" at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090619065522/http://www.daniweb.com/blogs/entry3288.html" class="uri"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090619065522/http://www.daniweb.com/blogs/entry3288.html&lt;/a&gt; (edit: archived) gave me inspiration so I contacted the author to ask him for help with ideas for this OS. He has since made a few more blogs about what Linux needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person's blog is now located at: &lt;a href="http://thefrugalnetworker.wordpress.com/" class="uri"&gt;http://thefrugalnetworker.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another blog, "10 Features Ubuntu Should Implement" at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120226075352/http://www.kumailht.com/blog/linux/10-features-ubuntu-should-implement/" class="uri"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120226075352/http://www.kumailht.com/blog/linux/10-features-ubuntu-should-implement/&lt;/a&gt; (edit 2021: now archived but imagegave me yet more inspiration of what to include in my custom made cloud OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like anyone and everyone to help make this Cloud system by any means possible, be that advertising, programming, or graphics so please contact me on (&lt;a href="mailto:cloudos@dandart.co.uk" class="email"&gt;cloudos@dandart.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) (edit 2021: change email) if you would like to be involved in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2008/10/cloud-os"/></entry></feed>
