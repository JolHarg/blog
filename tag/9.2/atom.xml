This blog and set of websites has finally been built using the new latest version of GHC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst it's not doing anything that special, it marks the ability to use this version to compile all its dependencies, which have had to be modified, bug-reported and pull-requested to get it all to work, and worked around when these have not been responded to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've forked a bunch of my dependencies to get them to work, and am very happy that I'm free to update the dependencies I use to work for my needs, and that's really the power of free/libre open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually quite surprised that the release cycle of GHC itself seems so quick, and it's the main libraries that many people use that lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TTFN!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2022/03/this-blog-now-built-with-ghc-92"/></entry></feed>
