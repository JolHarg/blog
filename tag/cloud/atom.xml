A description of the project follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenon is a portable web or browser based desktop for netbooks and thin clients, designed to be the easiest desktop ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desktop includes a new GUI stepping away from traditional menus and is optimised for touchscreen and small devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system integrates social networking features and standard desktop features into one software package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being browser-based, it is cross platform and cross architecture. It is built on HTML5 and PHP components, and can be run on extremely low-powered machines, allowing for cheap distribution and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backend can be run online (for users to access their data everywhere), on a personal LAN server, or on a small device, so the system can work offline, or if there are concerns about cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An API is available at xenon.kevinghadyani.com/wiki/index.php/Developing_Apps (edit 2021: page not archived), so anyone can start developing apps to distribute in Xenon's upcoming App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project's homepage is located at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091220083328/https://hackerlanes.com/"&gt;https://hackerlanes.com&lt;/a&gt; (edit 2021: archived) including the online desktop, ready for instant testing and a download of the alpha image for your server. The actual small footprint OS that will run on netbooks will come later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage contributions to the project, in the form of code (the languages currently used are (X)HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL), art (eg icons, backgrounds, GUI concepts) or even just ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To send any requests or contributions, or to join the project, please email the head developer at &lt;a href="mailto:dan.dart@googlemail.com"&gt;dan.dart@googlemail.com&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2009/12/xenon-alpha-released"/></entry><entry><id>cloud-os</id><title type="text">Cloud OS</title><updated>2008-10-28 16:08:00 UTC</updated><author><name>Dan Dart</name></author><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that a lot of companies have decided the Cloud (applications on the Internet) is the future. For me, I use a fair few to the extent that I don't use OpenOffice any more, just Google Apps. What particularly provoked me is that big companies are now doing it the whole hog. (see www.linux.com/feed/151604 (edit 2021: sorry, page not archived)) So I've decided to make one. It should be: Easy to use Intuitive Aesthetically pleasing Not be anything like today's GUIs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gathered a few people to help me with this big task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another blog, "5 things I wish Linux had" at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090619065522/http://www.daniweb.com/blogs/entry3288.html" class="uri"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090619065522/http://www.daniweb.com/blogs/entry3288.html&lt;/a&gt; (edit: archived) gave me inspiration so I contacted the author to ask him for help with ideas for this OS. He has since made a few more blogs about what Linux needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person's blog is now located at: &lt;a href="https://thefrugalnetworker.wordpress.com/" class="uri"&gt;https://thefrugalnetworker.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another blog, "10 Features Ubuntu Should Implement" at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120226075352/http://www.kumailht.com/blog/linux/10-features-ubuntu-should-implement/" class="uri"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120226075352/http://www.kumailht.com/blog/linux/10-features-ubuntu-should-implement/&lt;/a&gt; (edit 2021: now archived but imagegave me yet more inspiration of what to include in my custom made cloud OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like anyone and everyone to help make this Cloud system by any means possible, be that advertising, programming, or graphics so please contact me on (&lt;a href="mailto:cloudos@dandart.co.uk" class="email"&gt;cloudos@dandart.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) (edit 2021: change email) if you would like to be involved in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2008/10/cloud-os"/></entry></feed>
