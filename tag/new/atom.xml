It's been a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just released a major new build for all my websites and blogs. It features, amongst other things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes for RSS feed readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes for rendering older posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate "tag" and "post" permalink pages for each blog, in order to properly link to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice sidebar menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better mobile layout optimisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better embeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different font (do you like it?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various metadata and sitemaps to allow pages and posts to be properly indexed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming soon will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ability to choose the older font if there's enough demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dark mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any suggestions in the next period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will also allow me to more frequently write blog posts, so look forward to what's next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the current list of websites that have now been updated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dandart.co.uk"&gt;Personal website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jolharg.com"&gt;Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://m0ori.com"&gt;Radio ham website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And blogs affected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk"&gt;Personal blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.jolharg.com"&gt;Code blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.m0ori.com"&gt;Radio blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://madhackerreviews.com"&gt;Reviews website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to use this package for your own website, I'd be happy to help. And if you notice anything wrong with it, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ta-ta, and happy Y'all-Tired!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2024/12/updated-blogs"/></entry><entry><id>updated-blogs</id><title type="text">Updated Websites and Blogs!</title><updated>2024-12-26 21:17:00 UTC</updated><author><name>Dan Dart</name></author><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2025, a lot of the world's top websites do not work on an IPv6 connection, which is slated to become the default for new internet connections, due to IPv6 exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top sites stolen from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| ------- | ------ | | Website | Works? | | Google-owned websites | Yes | | Meta-owned websites | Yes | | X | Partial (Request succeeds but page complains as Fastly CDN has no IPv6 record) | | Wikipedia | Yes | | ChatGPT | Yes | | Reddit | Yes | | Yahoo | No, first redirect has no IPv6 record | | Amazon Shopping | No | | dzen.ru | No | | Baidu | No | | Tiktok | No | | Netflix | Yes | | Microsoft | Sometimes yes (e.g. microsoft.com, bing.com, office.com), sometimes no (e.g. microsoftonline.com, live.com, sharepoint.com) | | LinkedIn | Yes | | Naver | No | | Pinterest | No | | Bilibili | No | | Twitch | No | | VK | No | | Mail.ru | Yes | | Samsung | No | | Fandom | No | | Globo | No | | Canva | Yes | | DuckDuckGo | No | | Telegram | Yes | | Weather.com | Yes | | Quora | No | | Temu | No | | CNN | Doesn't load well... | | Zoom | Yes | | Ebay | No | | ---- | -- |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perplexing, perhaps. So what are people to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, here are the results for some of the most popular open source/free software:&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2024/12/updated-blogs"/></entry><entry><id>welcome-to-my-new-tech-blog</id><title type="text">Welcome to my new tech blog</title><updated>2022-09-11 22:24:11 UTC</updated><author><name>Dan Dart</name></author><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new tech blog! It's intended for things attributable to JolHarg (e.g. release announcements, tutorials, news, assorted tech things), in order to separate my non-code/non-"official" thoughts and opinions from those of my company, for what it's worth. This isn't due to anything I plan to say, but rather so that people who would like code-only thoughts can get them. I've moved some of my older posts from &lt;a href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk"&gt;my old blog&lt;/a&gt; to here if they were better attributed, too. Please let me know if you think I've miscategorised anything. Please also remember to reset your RSS feed reader, if you use the atom feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time here, my &lt;a href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk"&gt;non-tech blog is here&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href="https://blog.dandart.co.uk/atom.xml"&gt;atom feed is here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the comments are back!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2022/09/welcome-to-my-new-tech-blog"/></entry><entry><id>linux-is-not-ready-for-mainstream</id><title type="text">Linux is not ready for the mainstream</title><updated>2009-09-14 22:40:00 UTC</updated><author><name>Dan Dart</name></author><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Caught your eye?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I say this is not that Linux isn't quality - of course it is. It's not that Linux isn't ready to be used by the mainstream - it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that Linux doesn't want to be for the mainstream. A wide variety of developers exist, and quite a few don't wish there to be a standard. To me, a standard is what defines a product to market. But the main idea of Linux is to be free, not in the traditional cost-less sense (gratis) but in a freedom sort of way (libre). This means that people are free to do what they wish with it, and to keep it free if distributing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really make it, a product should be the same on all sides, easy to use, and have a common way of working. With the ridiculous amount of desktop environments (KDE...GNOME, etc) and text editors, this standardisation idea has become a laughing stock in the face of freedom. People want different things, they work in different ways. Some will want DEB, some will want RPM. That is why there will always be a million and one different flavours of Linux. And that is why marketing Linux is always going to be difficult. Open source is all well and good (Look how well Firefox did) but only in small, controlled packages such as these. If you let rip an OS designed to be free, then freedom will come, and you will not get one marketable product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, sadly, while the individual people who use Linux may like it, but Linux is simply too free to be for the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try to solve this, an ongoing project to create a standard easy-to-use small whole system, primarily for new small less-powerful devices, merging the gap between your computer and the cloud is encouraging developers to come and join. It is called Xenon, and is located at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100107134808/http://xenon.kevinghadyani.com/" class="uri"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100107134808/http://xenon.kevinghadyani.com/&lt;/a&gt; (edit 2021: archived). And it has absolutely nothing to do with Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.jolharg.com/post/2009/09/linux-is-not-ready-for-mainstream"/></entry></feed>
